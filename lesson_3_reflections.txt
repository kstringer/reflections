1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you need to access it from multiple computers or have more people than yourself working on it.


2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to
- date with your remote repository?

You might have commits on your remote that you don't want on your local.


3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of
another?

Fork makes a copy from their repository to yours, clones makes a copy from either a remote
repository to your local computer or from one location on a local computer to another location on
the same computer, while branch will just branch off while leaving the master alone.


4.What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

5.How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be
harder?

Use other version control systems or through email. Git and GitHub have measures to see if there
is conflicting code or other changes.

6.When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What
benefits does each approach have?

When working on major changes that could really chang the function of that master or when your
changes are just variations on the master.
